# Deferred work and future enhancements
# Prioritized by impact and effort

high_priority:
  frontmatter_validation:
    description: validate frontmatter against JSON schema
    schema: ~/rstnotes/_schemas/frontmatter.schema.json
    features:
      - diagnostic for invalid fields
      - completion for field names
      - completion for enum values (status, category)
    effort: medium
    files:
      - src/vault/metadata.rs
      - src/diagnostics.rs

  glossary_completion:
    description: complete {term} from glossary directive content
    requires: parse glossary directive body for term definitions
    effort: medium

medium_priority:
  figure_path_completion:
    description: complete image paths in figure directives
    notes: "{assets}" substitution points to external URL
    effort: low

  substitution_resolution:
    description: resolve {{var}} in hover previews
    source: conf.py myst_substitutions
    effort: medium

  cycle_detection:
    description: detect circular includes
    notes: petgraph is integrated; needs algorithm implementation
    effort: medium

low_priority:
  func_role:
    description: "{func}" role completion
    usage: 3 instances in rstnotes
    effort: low

  custom_directive_snippets:
    description: scaffolds for definition, ai-chat, ai-exchange
    effort: low

deferred_refactorings:
  test_helper_extraction:
    issue: create_test_vault_dir duplicated in tests
    recommendation: extract to shared test utilities module
    priority: low

  generic_select_abstraction:
    issue: select_references and select_myst_symbols have identical patterns
    recommendation: defer until "rule of three" met
    priority: low

not_planned:
  # Enabled in conf.py but unused in practice
  - colon fence ":::" syntax (0 uses)
  - definition lists
  - task lists
  - inline attributes
  - "{numref}" role
  - "{eq}" role

future_architecture:
  actor_model:
    description: background indexer thread
    current: RwLock blocks reads during writes
    proposed: channel-based async indexer
    benefits:
      - non-blocking completions during reindex
      - better large vault performance
    effort: high

recently_completed:
  graph_based_vault:
    description: replaced HashMap with petgraph DiGraph
    status: complete
    location: src/vault/graph.rs
    structs:
      - DocumentNode (graph nodes)
      - EdgeKind (Reference, Structure, Transclusion)
      - VaultGraph (DiGraph<DocumentNode, EdgeKind>)
    benefits_realized:
      - O(1) node lookup via node_index HashMap
      - graph traversal for backlinks
      - foundation for cycle detection

  api_consistency:
    description: unified select_* method return types
    status: complete
    note: all select methods now return Vec (empty = no results)
